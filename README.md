# Beans Analysis Project

## Overview
The Beans Analysis Project aims to conduct a prescriptive analysis of a bean dataset, focusing on data cleaning, transformation, and statistical summarization. The goal is to explore the characteristics of various bean classes and identify patterns that can inform decision-making regarding bean varieties.

## Contents
- **Data Preprocessing**: The project includes steps for cleaning the dataset, removing unnecessary columns, and filtering for specific classes of beans.
- **Variable Creation**: New variables are generated to categorize the data based on convex area.
- **Statistical Summaries**: The analysis involves calculating key statistical measures such as median, standard deviation, and percentiles for selected variables.
- **Contingency Tables**: A contingency table is constructed to explore the relationship between bean classifications and their convex area categories.

## Results

The final outputs include:
- **A cleaned and transformed dataset ready for analysis.
- **Summary statistics detailing the characteristics of different bean classes.
- **A contingency table highlighting the relationship between bean class and convex area category.
